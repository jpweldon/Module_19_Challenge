# Module_19_Challenge

# Fintech Finder

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable my customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

I will complete the code that enables my customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.
